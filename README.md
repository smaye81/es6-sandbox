ES6 Lunch N Learn Sandbox

To run app:

* Install Gulp globally using `npm install gulp -g`
* Run `npm install` from project root
* Run `gulp` from the project root
* Navigate to http://localhost:8081/webpack-dev-server/app/

Most of the ES6 goodness is in es6-controller.  There is an example of an ES6 service and a generator example also in
separate files.  But for true sandbox to play around with the code, use es6-controller.
